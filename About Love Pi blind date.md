<li><b>Why develop Love Pi? Suggested feedback:</b></li><br/>
In 2018, while chatting with my colleagues, I learned that there is a kind of matchmaking activity in the park called Blind Date Corner, which is simply to print out the information of the lovers with leaflets, and openly carry out marriage hunting activities. At that time, I thought that in the 21st century information age, how can there be such a nearly primitive marriage ceremony, which is time-consuming and laborious, so I had the idea of developing an online version of the park dating corner. But for various reasons, has not been paid to action. Behind Pi Network happened to have Hackathon developer competition activities, so it carried out the development of PI love dating network. Pi love has participated in the Pi Network Hackathon developer competition activity, search the keyword "Love" in the Pi browser brainstorming, you can see the introduction of Love Pi, the Love Pi project, please support the Love Pi, like and give a 5 star praise, thank you.<br/><br/>
                
The service tenet of Love Pi is: one for all, all for me. The development of the love dating network is purely interested, relying on love to generate electricity, there is no profit, the server used is purchased at its own expense, the server performance is general, so the access speed is not too fast, please forgive me. At present, Love Pi is still under development and improvement, please backup your data, in case we delete files test or system error for data recovery, please understand. Any suggestions or feedback, please email: <b>2870888684@qq.com</b><br/><br/><br/>
